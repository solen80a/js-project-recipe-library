- When the page is loaded, recipe cards based on the API data dynamically displays.
- Users can select filter for diets, and sorting most/least popular.
- When a filter or sorting option is picked, the DOM updates with these recipes.
- The code is split up into different functions that are named after what they do.
- The user can click a button that selects a random recipe, and the page display the selected item.
- There is an empty state, e.g. if there are no recipes matching the filter - a message is shown to the user.
